## Background information

This repository assumes you've read
my [blog post](https://blog.greenpants.net/heres-all-code-necessary-to-run-a-super-human-ai-from-the-year-2124/)
about the three most important lines of code in AI:

```py
import ai
ai.load_model()
ai.run()
```

These three lines of code are all that is necessary to run a super-human level AI in 2124 (or a ChatGPT-like AI in
2024). See for yourself!
